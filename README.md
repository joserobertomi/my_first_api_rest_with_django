# My First Django REST API

Welcome to my first Django REST API project! This repository contains the code for a simple RESTful API built using Django.

## Project Overview
This project serves as an introduction to building REST APIs with Django, a powerful web framework for Python. In this project, I've implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing resources.

## Features
- **API Endpoints**: Create, read, update, and delete resources via HTTP endpoints.
- **Django ORM**: Utilize Django's powerful Object-Relational Mapping for interacting with the database.
- **Serialization**: Serialize and deserialize data to and from JSON format.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure access to API endpoints.

## Installation
To run this project locally, make sure you have Python and Django installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repository`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Apply database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
5. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Usage
Once the development server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like cURL, Postman, or your favorite web browser. Here are some example endpoints:

- `GET /api/resource/`: Retrieve a list of all resources.
- `POST /api/resource/`: Create a new resource.
- `GET /api/resource/<id>/`: Retrieve a specific resource by ID.
- `PUT /api/resource/<id>/`: Update a specific resource by ID.
- `DELETE /api/resource/<id>/`: Delete a specific resource by ID.

Make sure to replace `<id>` with the actual ID of the resource you want to interact with.
